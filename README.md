    ro.py-discord is a small library that connects ro.py to Roblox verification services.

    Skip the boilerplate and easily create Discord bots that connect your users to their Roblox accounts without dealing with web requests.<br />
    ro.py-bloxlink works with both Bloxlink and RoVer to connect your users to their Roblox accounts, so no extra verification flow is needed.
